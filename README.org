* About
This package provides a small wrapper around the pacdiff utility used
on Arch Linux systems to update configuration files after package
updates.

The package provides a buffer with an overview, with all files, which
need maintenance.  You can then view the original configuration and
the pacnew/pacsave version via ediff to merge the changes.
Furthermore the buffer offers shortcuts to remove or overwrite with
the pacnew/pacsave file.

* Status
The main functionality is already present, but the package is still a
draft and some functions need implementation.

* License
